# Docs

These docs were replicated from **COLD BOT** for reference. In IMMO SNIPPY:

- **Frontend** = `frontend/` (root of this repo)
- **Backend** = `backend/` (root of this repo)

Paths in the docs may still mention `cold_bot` or `real-estate-scout`; treat those as `backend/` and `frontend/` respectively where it makes sense.

Key entries:

- **LOVABLE_FRONTEND_SPEC.md** — API contracts, data shapes, how to run the UI.
- **IMMO_SNIP_VS_COLD_BOT.md** — Comparison and integration notes.
- **REAL_ESTATE_SCOUT_LOCAL.md** — Running the frontend locally.
- **cold_bot/** — Cold Bot pipeline, scrapers, and upgrade plans.
