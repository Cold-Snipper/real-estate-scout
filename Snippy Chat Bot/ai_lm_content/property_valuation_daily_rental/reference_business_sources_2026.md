## 1. AirDNA (Primary Global STR Data Authority)

**2026 Outlook Report (Dec 2025):** STR investment conditions in Europe are the best since 2021 due to slower supply growth (3.5% YoY), stabilizing ADR, and resilient demand.

**Key insights:**
- Occupancy expected to bottom out in mid-2026 then recover.
- ADR growth forecast: +1.5% in 2026, accelerating in 2027.
- Supply growth slowed dramatically from 18% in 2024 to 3.5% in 2025 due to regulations.
- Demand nights grew 4.4% in 2025.
- Best performing markets: Coastal, mountain/lake, suburban areas near major cities.
- FIFA World Cup 2026 will be a major demand tailwind for host cities.

**Business implication:** Professional operators who use dynamic pricing and compliance tools will outperform DIY hosts significantly.
