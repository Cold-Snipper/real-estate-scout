## Key Metrics Explained

| Metric | Definition | Use in evaluation |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **ADR** | Average Daily Rate (what guests pay per night) | Benchmark listing's expected nightly rate vs city/neighborhood norm. |
| **Occupancy** | Annual average % of nights booked | Typical range 55–75%; strong cities 71–83%. Use for revenue estimate. |
| **Est. Annual Gross Revenue** | For a typical 2–3 bedroom apartment | Compare listing to this range when similar size/location. |
| **Price-to-Earnings Ratio** | Purchase price / annual net revenue (lower = better deal) | Lower P/E = stronger investment; use for "price_to_earnings_ratio" in output. |
| **Cap Rate** | Net operating income / purchase price (higher = better) | Alternative yield metric; higher = better for investors. |

## City-Level Benchmarks (2026)

Use these as typical ranges when listing city/neighborhood is known. Adjust for neighborhood (central vs suburban) and property type.

| City | ADR (€) | Occupancy % | Est. annual gross (2–3 bed) | Notes |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| Amsterdam | ~248 | 80% | High | Strict rules; high ADR |
| Lisbon | 114–180 | 83% | €36k–€72k range | Top performer |
| Madrid | — | 83% | Strong | Strong demand |
| Barcelona | — | 71%+ | Strong | Caps; still viable |
| Paris | 167–212 | — | High | Strict regs |
| Rome | — | — | Top market | Tier 1 |
| Dubrovnik | — | 79–90% (peak summer) | Seasonal | Extreme seasonality |
| Split | — | 79–90% (peak summer) | Seasonal | Coastal Croatia |
| Athens | — | — | Top market | Strong yield country |
| London | — | — | Tier 1 | Major market |

**ADR range across top markets:** €114–€248 (Amsterdam high, Lisbon/Madrid strong occupancy).

**Occupancy in strong cities:** 71–83%. Use 55–75% for conservative estimates in secondary areas.

**Annual revenue per listing (top markets):** €36,000–€72,000 for typical 2–3 bedroom.

When data is missing for a city, assume typical for that country/tier (Tier 1 = higher ADR and occupancy; coastal/summer = check seasonality).
